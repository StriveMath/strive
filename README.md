### Steps for setting up the development environment

1. You should have node and yarn preinstalled
2. Go to the root folder and install the packages by executing `yarn install`
3. Run the development server by running `yarn dev`
4. As you make changes in the files, the strive.js bundle is built and saved to dist folder automatically
