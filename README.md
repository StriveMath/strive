# Strive P5 Teaching Library
## A Library To Make Teaching P5 Easier
This library contains a variety of utility functions and abstractions to make teaching P5 easier

### Steps for setting up the development environment
1. You should have node and yarn preinstalled
2. Go to the root folder and install the packages by executing `yarn`
3. Run the development server by running `yarn start`

You can test all utility functions by making a P5 sketch in app.js. 
Currently, the library is only configured in global mode.
